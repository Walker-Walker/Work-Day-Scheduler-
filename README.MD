# Work Day Scheduler 
## Function
* Planner is supposed to store text data in local storage then be parsed back and printed when browser is refreshed.
* each day is supposed to show a red , green or gray background depending on the hour of the day.
* green for future tasks, gray for past tasks, and red or due tasks 

## RoadBlocks 
* I had a hard time with converting my id element attributes into moment js objectw so that i could compare current time using 
* before or after. if else statments would have been utilized to turn text background to either green red or gray.
